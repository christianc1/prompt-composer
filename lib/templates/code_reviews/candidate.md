### Feedback should be submitted in the following format

**Recommendation:** [This should be a very clear, actionable next step. E.g. Pass; Move to next stage]

**Summary:** [A short paragraph or two of your impressions from the interview. While there will be subjectivity in your assessment (especially around soft skills and culture/team fit), try to focus on objective feedback]

The Good:

- Thing they did well
- Another thing that they did well
- A particular technology they seem competent with

The Not-so-good

- A missed best-practice
- An poor architecture decision
- An antiquated technology that is no longer in use in enterprise architectures.

Note: Does not need to be three of each; this is a general guideline.
