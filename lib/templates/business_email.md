Subject: Proposal for Q3 Marketing Campaign

Dear Ms. Johnson,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to share our team's proposal for the upcoming Q3 marketing campaign that we discussed in last week's strategy meeting.

The attached document outlines our comprehensive plan, including budget allocations, timeline, and expected ROI. We've incorporated your feedback regarding the focus on digital channels and have allocated 60% of the budget to social media and search engine marketing.

Could we schedule a 30-minute meeting next Tuesday at 2:00 PM to review the proposal and address any questions you might have?

Best regards,
Alex Martinez
