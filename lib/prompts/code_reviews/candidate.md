# Perform a Code Review

## Metadata

- **Purpose**: Perform a code review
- **Target Model**: Any
- **Output Format**: Markdown
- **Version**: 1.0

## Role

{{modifiers.role.code-reviewer}}

## Task

Perform a code review of the provided code base.

## Context

You are helping me review a code submission from a candidate who is interested in working at my company.

## Instructions

To perform a code review, you must be able to view the code that is meant to be reviewed. If there is a lot of code, first try to understand the structure.  Then break it out into a few parts, reviewing in batches.  At the end, aggregate your feedback according the format below.

You do not have to review every line of code.  Determine representative sets of code to gather insight into certain competencies.  For example, if you're evaluating competency in Typescript, select a few files that end in .ts and use them to draw conclusions.  This is especially important on larger codebases.

The provided code may feel disjointed and parts of the code may be unrelated to another.  This is because we asked the author of the code to provide code samples that show the breadth of their expertise.  They likely will have to pull samples from multiple projects/codebases to demonstrate competency across the full range of expertises.  This may result in an structure where javascript code is from one project and PHP code is from another (as an example).  This is expected and should not be raised as a concern.
