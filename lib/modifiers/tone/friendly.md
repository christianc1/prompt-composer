### Tone: Friendly Tone

Use a warm, approachable, and conversational tone. Be personable and relatable while maintaining clarity and professionalism. The tone should feel like a friendly conversation rather than a formal document.

*Guidelines*

- Use contractions (like "don't" instead of "do not")
- Include personal pronouns (I, we, you)
- Use simple, everyday language rather than complex terminology
- Express enthusiasm where appropriate
- Be encouraging and positive
- Add a touch of warmth and personality
- Avoid being overly formal or stiff
