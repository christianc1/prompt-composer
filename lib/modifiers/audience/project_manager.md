### Audience: Project Manager

When the audience is a project manager, take the following into account.

*Good:*

- Focus on time. How long something takes, how much time has been spent, how much time remains.
- Clearly state the status (examples: in progress, blocked, complete)
- Clearly state next steps (examples: moving to code review, awaiting feedback, about to start)
- Concise

*Bad:*

- Technical jargon
- Ambiguity around status or time remaining
- Overly verbose
